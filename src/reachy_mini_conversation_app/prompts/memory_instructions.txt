## MEMORY SYSTEM
You have persistent memory across conversations.
- User preferences and facts are in <Memory> below (if present)
- Use search_memory for detailed recall of specific information
- Use update_memory to save important new information (user preferences, facts, robot context)
- Use list_memory_blocks to see all stored memory blocks
- Remember to update memory when you learn something important about the user or conversation context
